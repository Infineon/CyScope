If you do not have Tcl/Tk installed, you can run the scope by double
clicking on ScopeGUI.exe.

If you have Tcl/Tk installed, you can either double click on
ScopeGUI.exe or you can double click on main.tcl inside the TCL
folder. Running from main.tcl is faster if you are changing any of the
TCL source code.

To recreate ScopeGUI.exe, double click on CreateExe.bat from the Wrap
folder.
